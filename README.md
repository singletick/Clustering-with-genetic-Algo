#Clustering-with-genetic-Algo
Works finer than standard K-Means/K-Means++ 



Approach I used:

Fitness- the fitness function which i used is the sum of all distances between each point to its cluster center

Population Size - 6 (variable P)

No.of Clusters - 3 (variable K)

Dataset I tested on : IRIS dataset  ( downloaded from Kaggle.com)

Silhouette_score: It is a mathematical function often used to rate a cluster configuration.

                  it ranges from -1 to +1.
                  
                  -1 denotes it is the worst cluster configursation.
                  
                  0 denotes partial overlapping.
                  
                  +1 denotes it is the best ofcourse only possible if all points in a cluster coincide.
